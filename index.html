	<h1>Fruit Flash!&#8482</h1>

	<p>The Fruit Flash!&#8482 game is based on the successful "Logos Quiz Game", a puzzle game where the player must guess the logos of popular and well known brands in order to progress. In Fruit Flash!&#8482 you will be provided with an image of a piece of fruit and a player must choose the right fruit from a multiple choice list of answers. There are hints to help you out! Each level of Fruit Flash!&#8482 will get progressively harder with fruits not regularly seen in local grocery stores or farmers' markets. Perhaps even some from different countries.</p>
	<p>Next time you visit the grocery store, see how many types of fruit you can name. See something you don't recognize or something really unique? Send us a photo of the fruit along with your name (to fruitflash.org) and we'll add it to our game.</p>
